            <h3>“The body achieves what the mind believes.”</h3><br>
            <strong>
                our physical capabilities are not just determined by our bodily conditions
                but are also significantly influenced by our mental state.
                When we truly believe in our ability to achieve something,
                our mind sets a powerful intention that can drive our body to work towards that goal.

            <h3>“Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.” – Jim Rohn</h3>
            <strong>Discipline is the consistent effort we put towards our goals,
                regardless of obstacles, discomfort, or distractions.
                It’s about maintaining focus and a strong work ethic,
                even when motivation wanes. In the context of the gym,
                it means sticking to your workout routine, eating habits,
                and rest schedules to ensure that you reach your fitness objectives.
                Discipline ensures that you’re working towards your goals every day,
                making progress inevitable.</strong>

            <h3>All progress takes place outside the comfort zone.” – Michal Joan Bobak</h3>
            <strong>In fitness, this means pushing past your perceived limits,
                trying new exercises, increasing the intensity of your workouts,
                and challenging yourself consistently. It’s in these moments of discomfort that muscles grow,
                endurance improves, and personal records are broken.
                The comfort zone is a safe place, but it’s also where progress stagnates.
                To get stronger and fitter, you must venture outside of it.</strong>
